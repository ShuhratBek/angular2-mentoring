*Angular2 Directives
1. Create a directive to fill the city row in the table with a color depending on the temperature. The colder is outside, the colder is the color. You can create a formula to calculate the color or create a list of predefined colors. Incapsulate the logic of choosing the color inside the directive. Apply the directive to each city in the list.
2. Create a component to display the wind data. It should contain the arrow pointed to the wind direction as well as the wind speed near the arrow. Create a separate directive to rotate an arrow by degree specified.
3. Create a component to display overall city weather conditions using different icons. Use ngSwitch directive to select the appropriate icon.
4. As a plus, create your own structural directive
