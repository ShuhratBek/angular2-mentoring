*Angular2 Prerequisites

1) For our home task we will use a weather open api: https://openweathermap.org
2) How to get and How to use API key: http://openweathermap.org/appid#get
3) Create an application, using your github page on your github account: https://pages.github.com/
4) TS Config: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vylksfiw9el6pdf/tsconfig.json?dl=0
5) TS Lint config: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wg4c5et56jqn70t/tslint.json?dl=0
6) Using TypeScript knowledge create an application that uses weatherApi, which will run purely on the client-side in Chrome-54 browser (no server-side work expected).
7) Your app should define your current location and load a weather list for 100 cities near you.
8) Add Google Maps library to your project (just render it below the page)
9) Use Webpack 1.* as a module bundler.
10) Try to use as many TS features as possible.
11) It’s denied to use ‘any’ type.
12) You're not allowed to use any frameworks or library :)
13) Your application styling is not the requirement for this task, but it will be an additional bonus (see success criteria);
