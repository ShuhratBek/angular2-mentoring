*Angular2 Components
1. For home task please use webpack to build application
2. Create base angular 2 structure (please use release version)
3. Create at least next components:
map component
navigation (header)
footer
cities table
4. Please do not use any type. Create custom class instead.
5. Use lifecycle of components. Fetch data on init. Perform base configuration in constructor
6. Keep your components lightweight. Don not forget about single responsibility.
7. As a plus – add loader component to cover your page while data is fetching.
